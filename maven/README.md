# What is Maven?
Maven is a powerful build tool for Java projects. It is designed to simplify the process of building and managing Java projects, by providing a set of conventions and best practices for project organization and dependency management. Maven is built around the concept of a project object model (POM), which describes the structure and dependencies of a project, and provides a framework for building and packaging the project.

Maven is widely used in the Java community, and is supported by many popular Java IDEs, including Eclipse and IntelliJ IDEA.
