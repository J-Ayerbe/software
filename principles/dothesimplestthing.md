## Do The Simplest Thing That Could Possibly Work

The principle of "Do The Simplest Thing That Could Possibly Work" encourages developers to write code that is as simple and straightforward as possible, while still meeting the requirements of the problem at hand. This means avoiding unnecessary complexity, abstraction, and optimization until they are actually needed.

### Bad example:

```
public class BankAccount {
    private String accountNumber;
    private double balance;

    public BankAccount(String accountNumber, double balance) {
        this.accountNumber = accountNumber;
        this.balance = balance;
    }

    public void deposit(double amount) {
        double newBalance = balance + amount;
        balance = round(newBalance);
    }

    public void withdraw(double amount) {
        double newBalance = balance - amount;
        balance = round(newBalance);
        if (balance < 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Insufficient funds");
        }
    }

    public double getBalance() {
        return round(balance);
    }

    private double round(double value) {
        return Math.round(value * 100.0) / 100.0;
    }
}
```

This code also defines a BankAccount class, but the implementation of the deposit, withdraw, and getBalance methods is unnecessarily complex. Instead of simply adding or subtracting the amount from the balance, it uses a helper method to round the balance to two decimal places, which can introduce rounding errors. This approach is more difficult to read and understand than the simpler implementation.

### Good example:

```
public class BankAccount {
    private String accountNumber;
    private double balance;

    public BankAccount(String accountNumber, double balance) {
        this.accountNumber = accountNumber;
        this.balance = balance;
    }

    public void deposit(double amount) {
        balance += amount;
    }

    public void withdraw(double amount) {
        if (balance >= amount) {
            balance -= amount;
        } else {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Insufficient funds");
        }
    }

    public double getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }
}
```

In the case of the BankAccount class, the simpler implementation is not only easier to read and understand, but it also reduces the risk of introducing bugs or errors into the code. When you're faced with a programming task, start by considering the simplest possible solution that meets the requirements. Then, gradually refine and optimize the code as needed, while keeping it as simple and readable as possible.
